I am passionate about learning and creating. As a musician, I've found that creating elegant code is an art in itself and that both disciplines can fortify each other. I am skilled in HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and Angular. 

Apart from music and code, I enjoy nature, reading, exercising (I'm either running mountains or doing Krav Maga!) and watching shows and movies.
