## Explanation

Bloc Jams is a digital music player app that resmebles <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify.</a> With this project, I learned how to properly use Vanilla JS and JQuery to build a functioning application. It has an easy to manange interface and it uses BuzzFeed sounds for the mp3 files.


## Problem

The biggest task in creating this site was getting accustomed to the JQuery library and how to propery utilize it. Mainly, learning how to properly use selectors and to manipulate the DOM.


## Solution

Getting a better understanding of JS objects, reviewing JS fundamentals, and plenty of debugging made the completion of this project a lot easier. 



## Results

It is a fully functional application that allows users to play/pause and skip to the next/previous songs. It also allows users to move the seekbar to any other area of the song and to control volume within the application itself. 


## Conclusion

JQuery is an efficient and faster way to develop applications. It condenses Vanilla JS code and can make for more streamlined, easy to read code.
