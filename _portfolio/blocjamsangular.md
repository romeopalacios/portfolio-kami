## Explanation

Bloc Jams is a digital music player app that resmebles <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify.</a> With this project, I learned how to properly use Angular to refactor a previous Bloc Jams created with Vanilla JS and JQuery. 


## Problem

The main task was to learn how to incorporate and build the entire application using the Angular framework. It was challenging to learn how to initiate Angular modules, controllers and services. It was also difficult to learn and appropriately apply the different types of services. Finally, I had to learn the Angular directives to use in the html pages in order to have the desired functionality.

## Solution

The site was centered around one Angular module built with a UI-router to connect the different controllers and services. The controllers were organized according to the different pages within the application- one for the landing page, one for the collection of albums, and one for the album page that lists the album songs. A player-bar controller was also created to compartmentalize the functionality of the bottom bar and incorporate it in the appropriate views.


## Results

It is a fully functional application that allows users to play/pause and skip to the next/previous songs. It also allows users to move the seekbar to any other area of the song and to control volume within the application itself. 


## Conclusion

Angular was an efficient way to build this web based music player. BuzzFeed sounds made simple music tasks such as start, stop, and play easy. The UI-Router was an easy and efficient way to structure the application that made the single page application very effective.
