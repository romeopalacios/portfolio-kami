title: Biggest Challenge Learning to Code
---

The biggest challenge learning to code so far has been the balancing of my work and program schedule. As a musician, work can come unexpectedly and at differing times. Every week isn't quite the same and and some are busier than others. Learning new material and keeping up with the old has been a challenge with limited time but because of the pace curriculum, it's been a lot easier than it could be. The thing I've learned about programming and learning a lot of material in a condensed amount of time is that most things tie together. Once you've learned several languages, others (even if they are different), become easier to pick up and what you start realizing is that it's more so a way of thinking that you have to keep throughout the learning process. New languages or concepts can be daunting to learn but as long as you can keep in mind that most things follow a similar structure and logic, it starts becoming a lot simpler to break down and understand.
