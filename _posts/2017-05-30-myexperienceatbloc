title: My Experience at Bloc Coding School
---

I can say that my time at Bloc Coding School has been great. One of the main reasons why I chose Bloc as a bootcamp is because of my  unpredictable work schedule. The go at your own pace option is perfect for anyone who needs to balance work. I certainly wouldn't have been able to manage or even attend a three month bootcamp. For that, I'm truly grateful Bloc has it's curriculum set up  the way it is and that it's online.  
The curriculum runs in a smooth fashion and if you ever feel stuck you have a great mentor to lead in you in the right direction to solve any problems. The program covers many facets of software development, from front-end to back-end. I've learned HTML, CSS, GitHub, JS, JQuery, Angular and will soon touch on Rails. I like that Bloc gives you plenty of resources to reference and learn from outside of the curriculum. It gives you a good foundation to properly research and look for the right things. It has been an overall great experience at Bloc and definitely an awesome way to kickstart my journey into software development.
