title: My Goals as a Developer
---

My long term goals as a developer are to work with a company that produces software for music or to create my own music application. I ideally want to work with a software that people can use to record and write their own music, or an application that can teach people to pick up an instrument with ease. Apart from that, I find the health field interesting and would potentially like to delve into software development for a hospital or some sort of health service. 
Ultimately, what I really want to be able to do is to write good, elegant code. Code that is easy to read with concise solutions to big problems. Being able to find quick, good solutions to complex problems is what every good developer wants and I am striving to make that the top priority above anything else. Having good resources and practicing the right things consistently is the only way to get there. A top resource for understanding Javascript, that I've found is, <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent Javascript.</a> A lot of learning developers greatly learn a lot from this book and it simplifies big aspects of JS. Other sites like <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars,</a><a href="https://coderbyte.com/">Coderbyte,</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a> are great resources for learning skills and good practices. Like any other discipline, consistency is the most important thing.
